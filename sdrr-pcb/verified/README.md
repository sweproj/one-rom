# Verified PCB Revisions

This folder contains design and manufacturing files for verified revisions of the One ROM PCB.

These revisions have been tested and confirmed to work with specific MCU microcontroller variants and are supported by the stock One ROM firmware using the `HW_REV` field in the top-level [Makefile](/Makefile).

See the [sdrr-pcb README](../README.md) for recommended revisions.

# One ROM Ice USB J 24 Pin 

**Univerified**

Adds 2 more image select jumpers to Ice USB I, for a total of 4 image select jumpers.

There is a single set of gerbers, and two sets of POS/BOM files:
- One for the STM32F411RET6 MCU.
- One for the STM32F446RCT6 MCU.

To create the BOM for an alternate MCU, replace the microcontroller part number.  For the STM32F405RET6, you must also replace RC4/RC5/C9 - see the schematic for details.

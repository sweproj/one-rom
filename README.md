# One ROM

**[One ROM](https://onerom.org) - One ROM To Rule Them All**

The most flexible ROM replacement for your retro computer.  It is highly configurable and low-cost.  Get them fabbed at JLC for under $5 each in a quantity of 10 or more.

Based on a Raspberry Pi RP2350 (One ROM Fire 🔥) or STM32F4 (One ROM Ice ❄️).

One ROM is available as 24 pin and 28 pin versions, emulating nearly all systems' 24 and 28 pin ROMs, including any possible chip select configurations with a single hardware variants, and can serve different images to multiple ROM sockets simultaneously.

Replaces failed ROMs in Commodore 64s, VIC-20s, PETs, Ataris, BBC, TIs, disk drives and many other types of systems, like pinball machines and music synthesizers.

ROM types replaced:
- 24 pin: 2704, 2708, 2716, 2732, 2316, 2332, 2364
- 28 pin: 2764, 27128, 27256, 27512, 23128, 23256, 23512

As of the latest firmware, One ROM also supports RAM chips of the correct footprint, including the 6116 and 2016 2K SRAM chips.

One ROM was formerly known as Software Defined Retro ROM (SDRR).

## Quick Start

See https://onerom.org/start/

## Key Features

💰 Based on sub-$2 microcontrollers.  **[Choose from Raspberry Pi (Fire 🔥) or STM (Ice ❄️) flavours](docs/MCU-SELECTION.md)**.

⚡ **[Fast](docs/STM32-SELECTION.md)** enough for PETs, VIC-20s, C64s, 1541s, IEEE drives, etc. Support faster systems with higher end microcontroller.

📐 **[Same footprint](docs/images/sdrr-24-pin-side.png)** as original ROMs - doesn't overhang the socket like other solutions.

🔌 **[USB Version](https://onerom.org/prog/)** - no programmer required, program from your browser.

🚀 **[Quick programming](docs/PROGRAMMING.md)** - build and flash in <10 seconds.

🛠️ **[Reflash in situ](docs/PROGRAMMING.md)** - no need to remove the ROM from the host when reprogramming.

⚙️ **[Software configurable](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)** chip select lines - no hardware jumpers required.

💾 Stores up to **[16 ROM images](docs/STM32-SELECTION.md)** of different sizes and chip select configurations.  Image selectable via jumpers.

📦 **[Replace multiple ROMs with one ROM](docs/MULTI-ROM-SETS.md)** a single One ROM can replace up to 3 original ROMs e.g. all of C64 kernel, BASIC, character set.

🔀 **[Dynamic bank switching](docs/MULTI-ROM-SETS.md)** - switch between ROM images on the fly, e.g. different char ROMs.

💻 **[Hackable at runtime](docs/RUNTIME-ACCESS.md)** - change the ROM images being served and access telemetry from the ROM at runtime using **[Airfrog](https://piers.rocks/u/airfrog)** or other SWD probes.

🧩 **[Images combined automatically](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)** - no need to manually build up your own larger PROM image containing multiple retro ROMs.

🏭 **[Two layer PCB](sdrr-pcb/README.md)**, component on single-side, limited BOM for low manufacturing cost/complexity.

🎯 Supports multiple **[STM32F4xxR](docs/STM32-SELECTION.md)** variants: F401, F411, F405, F446 (others can be added).

🔓 **[Open source](LICENSE.md)** software and hardware.

## Debugging

The best place to start with debugging is [`Logging`](docs/LOGGING.md).  This will help you see what the One ROM is doing, and why it may not be working as expected.

If you have an [Airfrog](https://piers.rocks/u/airfrog), you can use it to inspect the One ROM firmware and its current state.

If you'd like a hand, raise an issue on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/piersfinlayson/software-defined-retro-rom/issues).  Please provide:

- the MCU you are using and the PCB type/revision
- the retro system you are trying to One ROM with
- any logging from One ROM
- ideally, the firmware image, if you are happy to share.

If you have built the firmware yourself, rather than using a pre-built release image, also provide:

- your build configuration
- the output from `make info-detail`.
